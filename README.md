Texted is a Vim like command line based text editor created as a project.
To install, you need to have the c++ ncurses library in your system. If not, install it using the command "sudo apt-get install libncurses-de" or refer to https://ostechnix.com/how-to-install-ncurses-library-in-linux/
To install Texted, go to the terminal and use the "make" command. Then type "./texted" and the program will start running in a new terminal window. To open a file or create a new file you can use the formal "./texted newfile.txt" or "./texted oldfile_to_be_opened.txt"
By default the mode is set to "view" mode. To go to insert mode press i on the keyboard. Once in insert mode you can edit the text. To go back to view mode press the escape key. To exit without saving press q and to save and exit press w while in the view mode.
